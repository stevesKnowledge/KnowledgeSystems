# Introduction 
Short Article describing pros and cons of Obsidian from the perspective of a journalist.
Notably, mentions two plugins, Kanban and Extract Url.   

Extract Url is extremely valuable, gets the contents of a webpage into a markdown document. 
See [Readme-Using Obsidian-Extract Url](../Readmes/Readme-Using%20Obsidian.md#Extract%20Url) and the [Extract Url](../Templates/Extract%20Url.md)  Template.

# Article Text 
I'm pretty bad at being an employee. I openly despise meetings, I say exactly what's on my mind, and I sincerely believe that many managers exist only to waste the time of otherwise productive people. I also could not be less interested in how my work impacts quarterly projections—I want to write things that people find helpful and entertaining.

So, yeah, I'm a freelancer.

I write for five publications, including the one you're reading now (obviously my favorite). The upside: I'm never in meetings. The downside: There's a lot to keep track of. I have to manage relationships with five editors. It's a challenge, and I've tried a full array of systems over the years, from spreadsheets to index cards, apps like [Trello](https://trello.com/), and way too many to-do list apps.

None of them quite did the trick, until I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a couple of years ago. This application has slowly gone from being a weird app I didn't understand to one I can't imagine functioning without. It's where I do all of my writing, yes, but also how I keep track of my ongoing articles as they move from brainstorming to pitching to publication.

This isn't a review of Obsidian ([I already wrote one](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/obsidian)). This is an outline of how I use this tool to get things done. Hopefully reading it gives you some ideas for how you could use it.

**Everything Offline All at Once**

First of all, what is Obsidian? The application bills itself as a "second brain," but you could it put in the same category as note-taking apps like OneNote or Evernote. Unlike those applications, though, Obsidian stores everything—notes, attachments, and even plugins—as simple text documents in a folder on your computer. This means you can use the application fully offline or sync the documents using the cloud storage service of your choice.

This has a few advantages. For one, your files are fully in your control: If Obsidian stopped existing tomorrow, I would still have access to my notes. For another, everything works offline. My favorite thing about Obsidian, though, is the extensive plugin ecosystem. There are [over a thousand Obsidian plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins), and I depend on several of them. There's [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), which allows you to create a board of cards you can move between tiles. There's [Extract URL](https://github.com/trashhalo/obsidian-extract-url), which can grab all text from any website and turn it into a note. I could list plugins for a long time. But the point is that you can customize Obsidian to work basically any way you want it to. I've done this to create a perfect setup for my workflow—one that allows me to do my planning and my actual writing in the same application.

My writing process has a progression: brainstorming ideas, pitching those ideas to editors, researching, writing, editing, and invoicing. Here's how I move through these steps in Obsidian.

Every article starts with an idea. I get these from all kinds of places. Sometimes I'm just using my computer, notice something that annoys me, endlessly research a solution to that issue, and then decide to write about it. Sometimes I notice a cool-looking app while reading the news or browsing Reddit. And sometimes I just spend a few hours brainstorming ideas. Whatever the case, I compile my ideas in a dedicated Kanban board on Obsidian. Every card on the board links to a dedicated document where I include any relevant links, expand on the idea, and note a bit about possible angles for the article.

When it comes time to take these ideas into the world, I decide which ones I'm going to pitch to which editors and drag them to a column for that publication. If the pitch is approved, I drag the card over to my "article queue" board, if not, I consider pitching it to another publication or put it in my "idea jail" to potentially revisit later.
