# Introduction
Obsidian is a powerful software tool designed to turn simple text files into a powerful knowledge cross referencing system.   This guide attempts to get you started using Obsidian, and demonstrate some of the power.  It also serves as a reference for some things I had to look up when I was getting started

# OBSIDIAN UI - Icons and Sidebars

## Using Obsidian (General)

1. First you have to **understand Markdown**, start with he official [Obsidian Markdown Reference](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)
2. Learn how to use [Tabs in Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Use+tabs+in+Obsidian)
   
3. **Creating Notes/Applying Template:** 
	1. ctrl-n = create new note, or maybe
	2. ctrl+o = open -> Helps to find related notes
	3. After creating Note press   **"Ctrl-T"** to apply a template (See [[ZettelKastenSystem#Types of Notes]])
	
4. **Using Tags**

	2. **Tag References:** Tap on a tag anywhere to show all references to a tag in the left pane
	    (click file folder icon in the top left of titl bard to get back to folder view)
	3. **Renaming Tags:** If the TagWrangler plugin is installed an enabled, right click on any tag to rename.

# Obsidian Markdown Notes

* **Separating Tags from Headers** : Headers have a space after the hashtag, Tags do not.
* **Relative Paths:** Always starting paths with a ./ or ../ helps with seeing them in other Markdown readers
   
* **Link to internal anchor** (heading in note):   See [Obsidian: internal Links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) .  
	*  Syntax:  [ [ Note Heading # internal anchor name] ]
	*  Example [[Readme-Using Obsidian#Things to learn about Obsidian]] 
	  
* **Images**.  To display an image use one of 
	* Obsidian Style    ! [ [ image-file-name ] |100x150]  (Works only in obsidian)
	* Relative file path:  :\[Title\]\\(../../image-file-name.png). (Works on GitHub!)
	* See [Stack Overflow: Changing Image Size in Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14675913/changing-image-size-in-markdown)
	* Centering Images:  See [reddit-ObsidianMD-does_anyone_know_how_to_place_images_in_the_center](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10uu09c/does_anyone_one_how_to_place_images_in_the_center/) and the "centerImage" snippet in the Obsidian snippets folder

# Troubleshooting 
## Obsidian Generates Temp files called "Icon?""
See note at  [[Readme-Obsidian Sync Methods#Problems with Icon?]]

## Things that confused me about Markdown In General:

I often expect Markdown Viewers to work like Word or Google Docs.  Markdown is not quite that capable.   These are things where I commonly am not able to accomplish exactly what I am setting out to do. 

* **Multi-Level Lists** In general, [Multi-level Lists](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-lists-obsidian/) in markdown are pretty easy, however in Obsidian, it is not easy to create second-level lists with a., b., c. .. Instead, use bullet points for second level lists as recommended in this [Obsidian feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/multi-level-lists-and-alphabetic-lists/3889)
  
* **Indenting Text:**  Creating things like a list with titles and a paragraph indent is not easy in Markdown.  Major flaw, IMO.   However, the web shares this characteristic.
