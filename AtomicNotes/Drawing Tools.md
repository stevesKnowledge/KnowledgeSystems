# Mermaid Drawing 
Mermaid is a method of drawing pictures like flowcharts, state diagrams, and swimlanes using text.
**Pros:**
* But it is text base and has a good plugin in Obsidian. 
* Lots of IDE Plugins available
* 
**Cons:**  
* I find it cumbersome 
* hard to control the layout
* someone needs to make a wysiwig editor for it.
