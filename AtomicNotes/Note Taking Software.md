# Note Taking Software

## Mindstone
* [Mindstone] is an app that lets you save notes and claims to help you remember why you saved it, and to be organized and effective about learning, as well as to organize and be able to share all of your learning from many sources.   Not sure how they make their money, but it appears to be free for individual use.  They have corporate plans.

# Markdown Editors 
These systems are more limited
Most Programmers Text Editors these days contain at least some Markdown syntax highlighting, and allow you to click on hyperlinks  to get to web pages, but they typically don't support inline image viewing out of the box.

## Typora
**Web Page:** [Typora.io](https://typora.io/)
